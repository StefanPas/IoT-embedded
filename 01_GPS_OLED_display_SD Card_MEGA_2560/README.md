The project is divided into two parts:

1. Development of a hardware prototype combining GPS, OLED display, SD cards module and arduino MEGA 2560, plus a 12 V LiPO battery. This prototype can show the GPS data on the OLED display and store satellite readings into a csv file. 

2. Python/Django platform alowing upload of the csv file, which is stored into a MogoDB. The system shows all routes based on the date taken from the csv files. Each route can be visualized by google map.
